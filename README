here we integrate some modification in controller and model so that any user twitter a word 
using $ (ex-$IBM) it will be display as a link 
if it is storeed in model name company

Here is the steps to integrate this application

1=> Requirment
      => You Should have mongodb version 2.0.1
      => You Should have ruby-1.9.2-p180   => patch is very importent so use ruby version exectly same
      => You Should have rails version 3.1.0



its good if you are using RVM

You Just follow these steps on terminal

$ rvm install 1.9.2-p180
$ rvm use 1.9.2-p180
$ rvm gemset create rails3.1.0
$ rvm gemset use rails3.1.0
$ gem install rails -v=3.1.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc

now come to /rstat.us-twitter directory
like this example=>  cd /var/www/rails_apps/rstat.us-twitter$ 
here you use your path

make sure about mongodb it is working properly for this you write on the terminal

$ mongo
it will responce like this

MongoDB shell version: 2.0.1
connecting to: test
> 
now just quit from here your mongodb working properly
for exiting use ctrl+c OR write quit on terminal


$ bundle install
if it gives some error related to rack version 1.3.5  like "You alreay install rack version 1.3.5 and you are requested to 1.3.2"
 Don't Worry 
just uninstall rake gem like this

$ gem unisnatall rack version 1.3.5
it will show you three options 

1> 1.3.1
2> 1.3.2  
3>1.3.5

$ 3

and remove this gem
and then again use bundel install

if gives some other error just add these gems in your gemfile

gem 'execjs'
gem 'therubyracer'

then again use bundle install   ====> ("Never Use bundle update")
